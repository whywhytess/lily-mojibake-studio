# Lily Mojibake Studio

A browser-based **mojibake (文字化け / garbled-text) subtitle video editor**, inspired
by the open, borderless web space around Shunji Iwai's film
*All About Lily Chou-Chou* (莉莉周).

Drop in a clip, place timed text events on a timeline, and render authentic
Shift_JIS→MacRoman corruption bursts over the video — then export to MP4/WebM,
entirely client-side.

## Features

- **Source video** — upload MP4/MOV/WEBM, or work on a plain black/white colour
  card when no clip is loaded
- **Text events** — add subtitles with independent start times and durations,
  arranged on a draggable/resizable timeline
- **Mojibake engine** — text is converted once to Shift_JIS and decoded as
  MacRoman to produce a fixed, byte-exact garbled string, then revealed as a
  growing prefix on the reference film's measured typing rhythm (see
  `app/mojibake.ts`); optional Apple-logo () byte injection
- **Transition modes** — black card, white flash, or none
- **Trim** — set in/out points on the video clip
- **Export** — records the canvas + audio via `MediaRecorder`, preferring MP4
  (`avc1`) and falling back to WebM

## Tech stack

- [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext) (React 19 / RSC on Cloudflare
  Workers) + [Vite](https://vite.dev)
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Cloudflare Workers runtime (`worker/index.ts`) for asset serving and image
  optimization
- Optional Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle scaffold (currently unused; `db/schema.ts` is
  intentionally empty)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start local dev server
npm run build    # production build
npm test         # build + verify the rendered editor shell
```

This project does not use `wrangler.jsonc`. Cloudflare D1/R2 binding names are
declared inline in `vite.config.ts` and simulated for local development.

## Project structure

```
app/
  page.tsx      # the editor: preview stage, timeline, inspector, export
  mojibake.ts   # Shift_JIS→MacRoman corruption engine + reference timing
  layout.tsx    # document shell
  globals.css   # editor styling
worker/         # Cloudflare Worker entry (assets + image optimization)
db/             # Drizzle/D1 scaffold (unused)
examples/d1/    # optional D1 example surface
public/assets/  # reference imagery (heritage masthead, field, site reference)
tests/          # server-render smoke test
```

## Useful Commands

- `npm run dev` — start local development
- `npm run build` — production build via vinext
- `npm test` — build, then verify the server-rendered editor shell
- `npm run db:generate` — generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

## Deployment

The app builds to a standard Cloudflare Workers bundle and can be deployed with
Wrangler. (Prior OpenAI Sites hosting coupling has been removed.)
